# House-Price-Prediction

## Problem Statement:
House Price is increasing every yr. for example a buyer wants to buy a house or a developer wants to sell a house. How will they decide the price to buy/sell the house ??????

## Solution:
Design a system/website that can predict the price of the house that can help the developer to determine the selling price of a house or a 
buyer who is planning to buy a house so he can know the price range in the future.

## Object:
To build a Machine Learning model using the house price data(for any region) that will predict the house price with a high degree of predictive accuracy.

## Requirements:
-[IDE: jupyternotebook](#IDE: jupyternotebook)
-[Python version : 3.9.12](#python version : 3.9.12)
-[Libraries : mentioned in requirements.txt file in repository](#libraries : mentioned in requirements.txt file in repository)


## Task:
import required library
data understanding
data cleaning
variable transformation (feature engineering)
perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
feature extraction(feature engineering)
splitting data into train and test
model building:
  >linear regression
  >rigde regression
  >lasso regresssion
model evaluation

## Conclusion:
Sucessfully built a House Price Predictor that predicts the house price for a region with an accuracy of 80%.
